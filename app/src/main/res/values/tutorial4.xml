        What is the mempool?
    </string>

    <string name="t4_p1">The word <i>mempool</i> stands for memory pool, and you can think of it as the place where transactions go before they get mined and become "official". When you send a transaction on the bitcoin network, your transaction get propagated across all computers that comprise the bitcoin network all over the world in about 2 to 5 seconds. But at this point your transaction is not really done, i.e. included in the blockchain. Instead, it sorts of waits in this "in-between" space where it is acknowledged by the network, but not yet made official.\n\nWe can think of this space (the mempool) as a theoretical place where transactions all come together and form a lineup, waiting for the next block to be mined to include many of them. Imagine an bus that comes by a lineup of people waiting to go to their part of town every 10 minutes or so. This bus can take only a certain number of pounds on board, and because everyone weights a different weight, the exact number of people who can fit in the bus at every run is different.\n\nThe mempool is the area where transactions wait for their turn to be mined. One special thing about this "lineup" of transactions that are all waiting to be made official (to get "mined", or included in the next bitcoin block), is that you can bid money to make sure you are up near the front of the line if you need to, or, inversely, you can save a lot of money by not bidding much if you are not worried about speed and you have time for this transaction to be mined. Eventually, (at the moment every weekend or so), the line clears and every transaction waiting in line does get through.
