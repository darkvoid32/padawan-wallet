        What are transaction fees?
    </string>

    <string name="t6_p1">The action of sending a transaction over the bitcoin network and having that transaction be validated, confirmed and stored across thousands of computers over the world is immensely valuable; it\'s also very costly.\n\nThe ability of the network to stay synchronized and distributed (which are properties important for further aspects that make it valuable, such as its censorship-resistance and its apolitical nature) implies that the load that the network can take in terms of transactions per minute is limited. The leaner and lighter the load on the network, the more resistant it is to attacks, and the more neutral and robust it stays. This desire to stay lean comes in contrast with the demand for transactions by Bitcoin users, and the balance between the two is struck by having a limited amount of space for the total amount of bytes that can be transacted over the network per amount of time, yet allowing users to "bid" on that space.\n\nBecause the space is limited in terms of bytes per block and there is only 1 new block being mined every 10 minutes or so, bitcoin users compete for space on the blockchain by providing a fee for their transaction. The transactions with the highest fees are prioritized by the miners when building blocks.
